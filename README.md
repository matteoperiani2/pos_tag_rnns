# Pos tagging with RNNs
Assignment 1 of 2022 NLP course at Unibo for Master Degree in AI. 

## Abstract 
The present work aims to study the Part-
of-speech (POS) tagging task as Sequence
Labbelling using Recurrent Neural Architec-
tures. The approach adopted follows some
fundamental steps: inspection of data, use of
an embedding model, pre-processing of sen-
tences and development of recurrent architec-
tures. Concerning this last step, an increas-
ing development in complexity was performed,
starting from a basic architecture.
